   Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   Change your working directory to the newly cloned repository:

4. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a .env.local file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary environment variables.

   ```bash
